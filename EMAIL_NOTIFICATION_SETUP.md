## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Email Provider

We recommend **Resend** for optimal inbox delivery:

#### **Option A: Resend (Recommended)**

1. **Sign up at**: https://resend.com
2. **Get your API key** from Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. **Verify your domain**:
   - Add these DNS records to your domain (dummair.com):
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: @
   Value: [Resend will provide this]
   
   Type: MX
   Name: @
   Value: [Resend will provide this]
   Priority: 10
   ```

4. **Add environment variables** in Vercel:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@dummair.com
   RESEND_FROM_NAME=DummAir Support
   ```

#### **Option B: SendGrid (Alternative)**

If you prefer SendGrid:

1. **Sign up at**: https://sendgrid.com
2. **Get API Key**: Settings ‚Üí API Keys ‚Üí Create API Key
3. **Verify sender email**: Sender Authentication ‚Üí Verify Single Sender
4. **Add environment variables**:
   ```bash
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=support@dummair.com
   SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=DummAir
   ```

5. **Update email service** (`src/lib/email/service.ts`):
   - Replace Resend API calls with SendGrid API
   - SendGrid endpoint: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send`

---

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations

The notification system requires a new table. Run this migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run the notifications table migration
\i database/migrations/008_create_notifications_table.sql
```

Or copy and paste the contents of `database/migrations/008_create_notifications_table.sql` into the Supabase SQL Editor.

Alternatively, run the complete migration script:
```sql
\i database/migrations/000_run_all_migrations.sql
```

---

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel project (or `.env.local` for development):

```bash
# ============================================================================
# EMAIL SERVICE (‚≠ê REQUIRED)
# ============================================================================
# Resend (Recommended)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@dummair.com
RESEND_FROM_NAME=DummAir Support

# Admin email (receives new order notifications)
ADMIN_EMAIL=abiolayoung229@gmail.com

# App URL (for email links and redirects)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# ============================================================================
# CRON JOB SECURITY (‚≠ê REQUIRED for payment reminders)
# ============================================================================
# Generate a secure random string for cron job authentication
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here
```

**Generate CRON_SECRET**:
```bash
# Use this command to generate a secure secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

---

### Step 4: Configure Vercel Cron Job

The payment reminder system uses Vercel Cron. This is already configured in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/payment-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schedule**: Runs daily at 9:00 AM UTC

**To change the schedule**, update the cron expression:
- `0 9 * * *` = Daily at 9:00 AM
- `0 */6 * * *` = Every 6 hours
- `0 0,12 * * *` = Twice daily (midnight and noon)

Learn more: https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs

---

### Step 5: Test the System

#### **Test Email Sending**

1. **Make a test order** and complete payment
2. **Check your inbox** for:
   - Payment confirmation email
   - Payment receipt
   
3. **Check admin inbox** for new order notification

#### **Test In-App Notifications**

1. **Log in as a registered user**
2. **Make an order and pay**
3. **Check notification bell** on dashboard
4. **You should see** payment confirmation notification

#### **Test Admin Email Sending**

1. **Log in as admin** (abiolayoung229@gmail.com)
2. **Go to any order** in admin dashboard
3. **Click "Send Email"** button
4. **Customer receives** itinerary email with ticket attachment

#### **Test Payment Reminders (Manual)**

Send a test request to trigger the cron job:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/payment-reminders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"
```

Or visit in browser (for GET):
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/payment-reminders
Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

// Example: Customize payment confirmation email
export function getPaymentConfirmationEmail(order: OrderDetails, isAdmin = false): string {
  // Your custom HTML template here
  const content = `
    <h2>Your custom content</h2>
    ...
  `;
  
  return getBaseTemplate(content);
}
```

### Add New Notification Types

1. **Update database enum**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE notifications 
   DROP CONSTRAINT notifications_type_check;
   
   ALTER TABLE notifications 
   ADD CONSTRAINT notifications_type_check 
   CHECK (type IN ('order_created', 'payment_confirmed', 'your_new_type', ...));
   ```

2. **Update TypeScript types** in `src/lib/notifications/service.ts`

3. **Add icon mapping** in `NotificationBell.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const iconMap: Record<string, string> = {
     your_new_type: 'üéâ',
     ...
   };
   ```

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Cron Endpoint**:
   - Always use `CRON_SECRET` for authentication
   - Rotate secret periodically
   - Monitor cron job logs in Vercel

2. **Email Rate Limiting**:
   - Resend free tier: 3,000 emails/month
   - SendGrid free tier: 100 emails/day
   - Consider upgrading for production use

3. **Database Security**:
   - Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled
   - Users can only see their own notifications
   - Service role used for admin operations

## üìà Monitoring & Logs

### Email Logs

All email attempts are logged in `email_logs` table:

```sql
SELECT 
  email_type,
  recipient,
  status,
  sent_at,
  error_message
FROM email_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Notification Logs

View user notifications:

```sql
SELECT 
  u.email as user_email,
  n.type,
  n.title,
  n.is_read,
  n.created_at
FROM notifications n
JOIN users u ON u.id = n.user_id
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Cron Job Logs

View in Vercel:
1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Navigate to **Deployments** ‚Üí **Functions**
3. Find `/api/cron/payment-reminders`
4. View execution logs

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. **Check API Keys**: Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. **Check domain verification**: Ensure domain is verified in Resend
3. **Check email logs**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM email_logs WHERE status = 'failed' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
4. **Check server logs** in Vercel for error messages

### Notifications Not Showing

1. **Verify migration**: Ensure notifications table exists
2. **Check RLS policies**: User should have permission to read their notifications
3. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
4. **Verify Supabase real-time** is enabled for notifications table

### Cron Job Not Running

1. **Check Vercel Cron is enabled** on your plan (requires Pro plan)
2. **Verify cron schedule** in `vercel.json`
3. **Check CRON_SECRET** is set correctly
4. **Test manually** with curl command (see Test section above)

### Attachments Not Working

1. **Ensure ticket_url is accessible** (public URL from Supabase Storage)
2. **Check file size**: Resend has attachment limits (40MB max)
3. **Verify ticket exists** in Supabase Storage before sending
