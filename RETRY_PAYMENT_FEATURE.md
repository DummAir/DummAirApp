# ðŸ”„ Retry Payment Feature - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Feature Complete

Clients can now retry payment for pending/failed orders directly from their dashboard!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Added

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/retry-payment`
**File:** `src/app/api/retry-payment/route.ts`

**Functionality:**
- Accepts `orderId` and `provider` (stripe or flutterwave)
- Fetches order details with passenger information
- Validates order status (must be `pending_payment`)
- Calculates payment amount based on flight type and travelers
- Initializes payment with selected provider
- Returns payment URL for redirect

**Security:**
- Only allows retry for orders with `pending_payment` status
- Fetches order and passenger data securely from database
- Validates all required fields

---

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard: Retry Payment UI
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**New Features:**
- âœ… "Complete Payment" button on all pending orders
- âœ… Payment provider selection modal (Stripe & Flutterwave)
- âœ… Visual feedback during payment processing
- âœ… Automatic redirect to payment gateway
- âœ… Clean, user-friendly UI with hover effects

**UI Components Added:**
1. **Retry Payment Button** - Appears on pending_payment orders
2. **Payment Modal** - Shows Stripe and Flutterwave options
3. **Loading States** - Spinner during payment initialization
4. **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User logs into dashboard** â†’ Sees their orders
2. **Clicks "Complete Payment"** on pending order â†’ Modal appears
3. **Selects payment provider** (Stripe or Flutterwave) â†’ Payment initializes
4. **Redirected to payment gateway** â†’ Completes payment
5. **Returns to confirmation page** â†’ Order marked as paid

### Technical Flow:
```
Dashboard â†’ handleRetryPayment() 
         â†’ Shows Payment Modal 
         â†’ User selects provider 
         â†’ processRetryPayment() 
         â†’ POST /api/retry-payment 
         â†’ Fetch order + passengers 
         â†’ Initialize payment (Stripe/Flutterwave) 
         â†’ Return payment URL 
         â†’ Redirect user
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Test Scenarios:
- [ ] Login to dashboard with account that has pending orders
- [ ] Verify "Complete Payment" button appears on pending orders only
- [ ] Click "Complete Payment" - modal should open
- [ ] Select Stripe - should redirect to Stripe checkout
- [ ] Return and try Flutterwave - should redirect to Flutterwave
- [ ] Test with completed order - no retry button should show
- [ ] Test with paid order - no retry button should show
- [ ] Test error handling - invalid order ID
- [ ] Test cancel button - modal should close

### Expected Behavior:
1. âœ… Only pending_payment orders show retry button
2. âœ… Completed orders show download ticket button
3. âœ… Paid orders show status only
4. âœ… Payment modal is responsive on mobile
5. âœ… Loading states work correctly
6. âœ… Redirects work after provider selection
7. âœ… Error messages display properly
