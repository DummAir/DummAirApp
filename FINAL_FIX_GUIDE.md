# ✅ FINAL FIX - Notifications & Admin Emails

## 🎉 **What Was Fixed**

### **Issue 1: In-App Notifications ✅ FIXED**

**Solution:** Completely rewrote API to use userId parameter instead  
**Status:** 🟢 **DEPLOYED AND WORKING**

### **Issue 2: Admin Emails ⚠️ NEEDS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**
**Problem:** Missing environment variables  
**Solution:** Added comprehensive logging + test endpoint  
**Status:** 🟡 **Code ready, needs configuration**

## 🚀 **STEP-BY-STEP SETUP (5 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variables in Vercel**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your **DummAir** project
3. Go to: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these **3 variables**:

RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# 2. Admin Email (Where to receive order notifications)
ADMIN_EMAIL=payment@dummair.com

# 3. From Email (Must be verified domain)
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@dummair.com
```

5. Select: ✅ **Production** ✅ **Preview** ✅ **Development**
6. Click **Save**

### **Step 2: Redeploy**

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click latest deployment → **...** menu → **Redeploy**
3. Wait 2-3 minutes ⏰

---

## 🧪 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Test 1: Email Configuration (Do This First!)**

Use the new test endpoint to verify email setup:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-email@example.com"}'
```

**Or test in browser console:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/test-email', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ email: 'your-email@example.com' })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test email sent successfully",
  "messageId": "xxx-xxx-xxx",
  "config": {
    "hasResendKey": true,
    "fromEmail": "support@dummair.com",
    "adminEmail": "payment@dummair.com"
  }
}
```

✅ **If this works**, admin emails will work too!  
❌ **If this fails**, check environment variables

### **Test 2: Admin Email Notification**

**Create a Test Order:**

1. Go to your website (logged out)
2. Click "Book Now"
3. Fill flight details
4. Add passenger info
5. Complete payment (Stripe test: `4242 4242 4242 4242`)

**Check Logs in Vercel:**

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → **Deployments** → **Functions**
2. Find `/api/webhooks/payment-success`
3. Look for these logs:

```
🔍 Admin Email Configuration:
   ADMIN_EMAIL env var: payment@dummair.com
   Sending to: payment@dummair.com
   RESEND_API_KEY exists: true
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL: support@dummair.com
✅ URGENT admin notification sent to payment@dummair.com
   Message ID: xxx-xxx-xxx
```

**Check Email Inbox:**

- Go to **payment@dummair.com** inbox
- You should see: **"🚨 URGENT: New Paid Order DUM-XXXXXXXX - Action Required"**

---

### **Test 3: In-App Notifications**

**Test Notifications:**

1. **Create account** and **log in**
2. Make an order and **complete payment**
3. Look at **notification bell** (top right)
4. Should show **red badge** with count
5. Click bell → See notifications dropdown
6. Should see: **"Payment Confirmed"** notification

**Test Real-Time Updates:**

1. Have admin **upload a ticket** for your order
2. Notification bell should **auto-update** (within 5 seconds)
3. Click bell → See **"🎫 Your Ticket Has Been Uploaded!"**
4. Click notification → Navigate to dashboard

---

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING**

### **If Admin Emails Don't Work:**

**Check 1: Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# Verify these exist:
✅ RESEND_API_KEY
✅ ADMIN_EMAIL
✅ RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
```

**Check 2: Resend API Key Valid**
1. Go to https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Click your API key
3. Check if it's active (not expired/revoked)
4. Check sending limits (3,000/month on free tier)

**Check 3: Domain Verified**
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Check if **dummair.com** is verified
3. If not, add DNS records:
   - TXT record for domain verification
   - MX record for email receiving

**Check 4: Email Logs in Database**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT 
  created_at,
  recipient,
  email_type,
  status,
  error_message,
  provider_message_id
FROM email_logs
WHERE email_type = 'admin_notification'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check 5: Vercel Function Logs**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Functions
2. Find `/api/webhooks/payment-success`
3. Check for errors in logs
4. Look for "Admin Email Configuration" logs

---

### **If Notifications Don't Work:**

**Check 1: Are They Being Created?**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT 
  n.id,
  n.type,
  n.title,
  n.is_read,
  n.created_at,
  u.email
FROM notifications n
JOIN users u ON u.id = n.user_id
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check 2: Browser Console**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for errors
4. Check **Network** tab for `/api/notifications` requests

**Check 3: Real-Time Subscription**
```javascript
// In browser console:
// Check if Supabase is connected
supabase.channel('test').subscribe((status) => {
  console.log('Supabase status:', status)
})
```

---

## 📊 **SQL Queries for Monitoring**

### **Check All Email Activity:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  email_type,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM email_logs
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), email_type, status
ORDER BY date DESC, email_type;
```

### **Check Failed Emails:**
```sql
SELECT 
  created_at,
  email_type,
  recipient,
  error_message,
  subject
FROM email_logs
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### **Check Notification Delivery:**
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  n.type,
  n.title,
  n.is_read,
  n.created_at
FROM notifications n
JOIN users u ON u.id = n.user_id
WHERE n.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC;
```
