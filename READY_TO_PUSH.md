## ⚡ After Pushing - Complete the Fix

### Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variables

**Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Add/Update these variables:**

1. **NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL** (NEW - Critical for Flutterwave)
   ```
   Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
   Value: https://your-actual-deployment.vercel.app
   ```
   - Get your URL from: Vercel → Deployments → Latest deployment
   - NO trailing slash!

2. **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** (UPDATE)
   ```
   Key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   Value: [Use your new Stripe secret key]
   ```
   - The new key you provided earlier

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to: Deployments tab
2. Click ⋯ on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait for completion (1-2 minutes)

### Step 3: Test Both Payment Methods
1. **Test Flutterwave:**
   - Should redirect correctly (no "undefined" error)
   
2. **Test Stripe:**
   - Should process payment (no "expired key" error)
