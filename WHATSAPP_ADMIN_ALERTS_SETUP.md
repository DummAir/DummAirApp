## 🚀 **Alternative: Simple WhatsApp Link**

If you don't want to set up API (quick workaround):

The email notification could include a WhatsApp link that you can click to get notified. But this requires you to check email first, so API notifications are better for instant alerts.

---

## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**For Immediate Use:**
1. ✅ Set up **Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox** (10 minutes)
2. ✅ Test with your phone
3. ✅ Get instant order notifications

**For Production:**
1. ✅ Apply for **WhatsApp Business API** (wait 2-5 days for approval)
2. ✅ Get your own business number
3. ✅ Remove sandbox limitations
