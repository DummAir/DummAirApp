## 📱 About Push Notifications

**Current:** In-app notifications (web only)
- ✅ Works when user is on the website
- ✅ Notification bell badge with unread count
- ✅ Real-time updates

**Future Enhancement (Optional):**
To get phone push notifications, you would need to:
1. Set up Progressive Web App (PWA)
2. Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
3. Request notification permissions
4. Send push notifications to mobile devices

**For now:** In-app notifications are perfect for testing and staying within free tier limits!
